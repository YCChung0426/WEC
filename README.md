## WEC (Wave Energy Converter) 

### Overview

The **WEC** is a project aimed at providing a comprehensive data visualization interface for wave energy / power generation. This system serves as a tool for monitoring and controlling wave power generators, enabling real-time tracking of power generation levels and control over the operational status of the generator units.

### Features

- **Real-time Data Display:** Our interface offers a live display of current power generation levels, allowing users to track the efficiency of the wave power generators instantaneously.

- **Generator Control:** The system facilitates the remote control of wave power generator units. Users can adjust settings and monitor the status of each unit from the convenience of the interface.

### Development Status

As of now, the *WEC* is still in the development phase. Our dedicated team is working tirelessly to enhance and refine the features of the interface, ensuring a robust and efficient tool for managing wave power generation.
